## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Light off-white (#FAF9F6) with subtle dotted grid texture for a handcrafted feel.
- Primary: Muted lavender (#D8CEE6) for a soft and elegant touch. It lends the site a sophisticated feel. Since it has moderate saturation and brightness, it contrasts with both the light background, and with the accent.
- Accent: Slate blue (#A7BED3) to complement the lavender with a cool contrast. The brightness and saturation differ enough from the primary for contrast, but the hues are close on the color wheel.
- Headline font: 'Literata' serif for hero headlines and project titles, lending a handcrafted, premium aesthetic.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif for body text and navigation, ensuring readability and a clean modern look.
- Use Lucide/Phosphor icons for a clean and modern feel.
- Employ generous whitespace and clean grid alignment for a minimalist, uncluttered design.
- Implement smooth hover effects, micro-interactions, and gentle fade-ins for subtle, non-distracting animations.
